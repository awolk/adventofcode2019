# Advent of Code 2019 Solutions
I have completed the [2019 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2019) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).  
Note that the solution for day 12 requires [Nightly Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.2.0/book/nightly-rust.html), as it uses [const generics](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2000-const-generics.md).
